# Current-Emerging-Trends

This project involved developing a reinforcement learning-based intelligent agent to solve a treasure hunt game. I was provided with a foundational codebase that included the environment simulation and basic structure for the agent. Building on that, I developed the core reinforcement learning logic. Such as the Q-learning algorithm, reward system, state-action handling, and agent training loop. I focused on improving the agent’s learning strategy through experimentation.

Through this project, I saw firsthand how concepts like exploration vs. exploitation, state-value estimation, and policy improvement come together in AI development. These are foundational ideas in AI development that focuses on using algorithms and computation to solve real-world problems. A computer scientist approaches problems by identifying patterns, decomposing challenges, and using logic and data to design solutions — just as I did with this agent.

Finally, this project reminded me of the ethical weight that comes with designing intelligent systems capapble of replacing humans. It raises important questions about accountability, trust, job displacement, and the responsibility to ensure that such systems enhance human lives rather than undermine it.
